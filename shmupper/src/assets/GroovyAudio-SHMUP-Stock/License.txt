Introduction
============
Hi and congratulations on obtaining this stock library which I created for the Shoot'em Up 
indie developers at http://www.shmup-dev.com to encourage and assist new development of 
Shoot'em Up games.

I hae been a professional sound designer and composer in the Video Games Industry since 2002. 
This library was created as a gift back to the indie development community which helped me 
build my experience on such projects as: Adventures of BOBO, WarBlade, Rick Dangerous X-Mas GBA, 
Monkey's Oddysee.
